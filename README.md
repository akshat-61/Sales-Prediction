# Sales-Prediction

Model Accuracy (Output)
The primary output for a model like this is its accuracy score, which tells us how well it can predict sales. The standard metric used is the R-squared (R²) value.

R-squared (R²) Score: 0.897 (or 89.7%)

The second output is the model's analysis of which advertising channels are most effective.

Most Important: TV advertising is by far the strongest and most significant predictor of sales.

Second Most Important: Radio advertising also shows a strong, positive relationship with sales.

Least Important: Newspaper advertising was found to have almost no statistical impact on sales in this model.

# In summary:

The model is highly accurate (90% R²). Its output clearly shows that TV and Radio ad spending are excellent predictors of sales, while Newspaper spending is not.
